## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. AIContentGenerator Service (`advisory/services.py`)
```python
class AIContentGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize Gemini API client
        
    def generate_agricultural_report(self, user_data):
        # Main method for generating reports
        
    def _build_agricultural_prompt(self, user_data):
        # Construct comprehensive prompt for Gemini
        
    def _parse_ai_response(self, response_text):
        # Parse and structure AI response
        
    def _generate_pdf(self, content_data, user_data):
        # Create professional PDF report
        
    def _save_pdf(self, pdf_buffer, title):
        # Save PDF to storage and return URL
```

#### 2. Enhanced Resource Model
The Resource model has been extended with AI-specific fields:

```python
class Resource(models.Model):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # AI Generation fields
    is_ai_generated = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    ai_generation_data = models.JSONField(default=dict, blank=True)
    ai_model_used = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    generated_for_user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    generation_timestamp = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
```

#### 3. API Endpoints
New endpoints added to ResourceViewSet:

- `POST /api/advisory/resources/generate_ai_content/` - Generate new AI content
- `GET /api/advisory/resources/my_ai_resources/` - Get user's AI-generated resources
- `GET /api/advisory/resources/ai_generated/` - Get all AI-generated resources

### Frontend Components

#### 1. AIGenerationModal (`AIGenerationModal.jsx`)
- Multi-step form for data collection
- Real-time validation and error handling
- Progress indicators and loading states
- Success feedback and download options

#### 2. Enhanced Advisory Component
- AI generation section with prominent call-to-action
- Visual indicators for AI-generated resources
- Integration with existing resource management

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# AI Content Generation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### 2. Dependencies

python manage.py migrate
```

## Usage

### 1. User Flow
1. User navigates to Advisory â†’ Resources section
2. Clicks "Generate Report" button
3. Completes 3-step data collection form
4. AI generates personalized report
5. User downloads PDF report
6. Report appears in resources list with AI indicator

### 2. API Usage
```javascript
// Generate AI content
const response = await fetch('/api/advisory/resources/generate_ai_content/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    weather: { /* weather data */ },
    crop: { /* crop data */ },
    market: { /* market data */ },
    sales: { /* sales data */ },
